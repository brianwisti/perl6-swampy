perl6-swampy
============

A Perl 6 glue wrapper for the Python Swampy environment - WARNING VERY DUMB

== Author ==

Brian Wisti <https://github.com/brianwisti>

== Prerequisites ==

* Perl 6
* Python
* [Swampy](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/)
* A UNIX-ish system is assumed right now.

== Usage ==

No.

Really. It's a bad idea right now. I'm pretty sure it only works on my machine, and only two of the Swampy functions are wrapped. I'm just putting it here because I am pretty sure that it will get better.

== Goals ==

In rough order:

1. Make it a real live module with documentation and tests and stuff
2. Wrap enough Swampy functionality to finish [Think Python](http://thinkpython.com) in [Perl 6](http://blogs.perl.org/mt/mt-search.fcgi?blog_id=270&tag=thinkperl6&limit=20)
3. Interactive mode: you type in a directive, and the little turtle works its magic.
